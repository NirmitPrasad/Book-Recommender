# Book-Recommender
An AI-powered Book Recommender System that suggests books to users based on their interests, preferences, and reading history. The goal of this project is to make book discovery easier and more personalized using machine learning and recommendation algorithms.

🚀 Features

🔍 Personalized Recommendations – Suggests books based on user preferences

📖 Content-Based Filtering – Uses book features like author, genre, and keywords

👥 Collaborative Filtering – Recommends books using ratings and user similarity

⚡ Hybrid Approach – Combines multiple algorithms for improved accuracy

📊 Data Handling – Efficient processing of large book datasets

🌐 Extensible – Can integrate with APIs like Google Books or Goodreads

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Core programming language

Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing and manipulation

Scikit-learn / Surprise – Recommendation models

Cosine Similarity, KNN, SVD – Algorithms for recommendations

Flask / FastAPI (optional) – Backend for deployment

Streamlit (optional) – Simple interactive UI

⚙️ How It Works

Content-Based Filtering – Recommends books similar to a user’s favorites by analyzing metadata (author, genre, description).

Collaborative Filtering – Finds patterns in user–item interactions (ratings/reviews). If two users have similar tastes, books liked by one are recommended to the other.

Hybrid Model – Combines both methods for balanced and diverse recommendations.

🎯 Applications

Online bookstores for personalized book suggestions

E-libraries to improve user engagement

Educational platforms for recommending study material

Personal assistants for book lovers

📌 Future Improvements

Integration with Google Books API for real-time data

Advanced Deep Learning models (Neural CF, BERT embeddings)

Mobile-friendly UI
